## Overview

Implement comprehensive animation system across M.O.S.S. to provide smooth, delightful micro-interactions and transitions while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility. This includes page transitions, loading states, form interactions, modal animations, toast notifications, and scroll-driven effects. All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and maintain 60 FPS performance on target devices.

**Key Technologies**: Framer Motion (primary), React Spring (physics-based effects), Intersection Observer API

**User Experience Goals**:
- Make the application feel responsive and polished
- Provide visual feedback for all user interactions
- Reduce perceived loading times with skeleton screens and smooth transitions
- Maintain accessibility for users with motion sensitivity
- Keep animations subtle and fast (150-300ms typical duration)

---

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**:
- Framer Motion library (to be installed)
- Sonner library (already installed for toast notifications)
- React Countup library (optional, for number animations)

**Internal Dependencies**:
- Design system already established (colors, typography, spacing)
- Core components built (Button, Input, Card, Modal, etc.)
- Page routing structure in place (Next.js App Router)

**No Blockers**: This feature can be implemented independently

## Implementation Notes

**Best Practices**:
1. **Start Simple**: Implement basic animations first, add complexity later
2. **Performance First**: Always test FPS, optimize before adding more animations
3. **Consistency**: Use animation presets to maintain consistent timing/easing
4. **Accessibility**: Test with reduced motion enabled throughout development
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Animations should enhance, not block functionality

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't animate layout properties (width, height, margin, padding)
- Don't overuse animations (subtle is better)
- Don't forget exit animations (use AnimatePresence)
- Don't ignore reduced motion preferences
- Don't add animations without testing performance

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test animations incrementally as you implement each phase
- Use browser DevTools Performance tab constantly
- Keep reduced motion toggle easily accessible during development
- Test on real devices, not just emulators

   - easeInOut: Continuous motion (hovers, toggles)
   - spring: Physics-based (modals, drawers, drag)

   ## Code Examples
   [Include copy-paste ready examples]

   ## Performance Tips
   - Only animate transform and opacity
   - Avoid width, height, margin, padding
   - Use will-change sparingly

### Technical Decisions

1. **Type Safety Workaround**: Used wrapper approach for Button component (motion.div wrapping button) to avoid type conflicts between Framer Motion's motion.button and React's ButtonHTMLAttributes. This preserves all button functionality while enabling animations.

2. **Card Animation**: Made hover animation optional with `noHover` prop. When disabled, renders regular div without motion wrapper for better performance.

3. **Reduced Motion**: Implemented comprehensive reduced motion support:
   - Global config: `reducedMotion: "user"` in Framer Motion
   - Hook: `useReducedMotion()` for conditional logic
   - Utility: `getReducedMotionVariant()` for stripping transform properties
   - All animation presets respect reduced motion automatically

4. **Performance**: All animations use GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity). No width/height/margin animations that cause reflows.

### Files Created

**Animation Library**:
- `/src/lib/animations/config.ts` (96 lines)
- `/src/lib/animations/presets.ts` (273 lines)
- `/src/lib/animations/utils.ts` (115 lines)
- `/src/lib/animations/hooks.ts` (55 lines)

**Animation Components**:
- `/src/components/animations/PageTransition.tsx` (53 lines)
- `/src/components/animations/AnimatedList.tsx` (71 lines)
- `/src/components/animations/Skeleton.tsx` (161 lines)
- `/src/components/animations/ProgressBar.tsx` (230 lines)

**UI Components**:
- `/src/components/ui/Modal.tsx` (304 lines)

**Documentation**:
- `/planning/animation-guidelines.md` (823 lines)

**Total**: 2,181 lines of new code

### Files Modified

- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Added PageTransition wrapper
- `/src/components/ui/Button.tsx` - Added hover/tap animations, animated spinner
- `/src/components/ui/Card.tsx` - Added hover lift animation
- `/src/components/ui/Input.tsx` - Added shake animation for errors
- `/src/components/ui/Checkbox.tsx` - Enhanced checkmark animation
- `/src/components/dashboard/StatWidget.tsx` - Added count-up animation

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Apply PageTransition to all pages** - Wrap remaining pages for consistent transitions
2. **Apply AnimatedList to list views** - Devices, People, Networks, etc.
3. **Apply Skeleton to loading states** - Replace "Loading..." text with skeleton screens
4. **Configure Sonner toasts** - Add animation config for toast notifications
5. **Add Sidebar animations** - Implement expand/collapse animation if sidebar exists
6. **Add Tab animations** - Implement slide animation for tab content switching
7. **Add Breadcrumb animations** - Fade transitions for breadcrumb updates
8. **Manual testing** - Cross-browser, device, performance, accessibility testing
9. **Playwright tests** - Automate UAT test cases from plan

### Known Limitations

1. **Type conflicts with Framer Motion**: motion.button and motion.div have type incompatibilities with React event handlers (onDrag, onAnimationStart, etc.). Solved by using wrapper div for Button, conditional rendering for Card.

2. **Page transitions**: Next.js App Router doesn't natively support exit animations between routes. PageTransition component provides enter animations only. Full page transition support would require additional routing wrapper.

3. **Build warnings**: Next.js shows warning about non-standard NODE_ENV value (from environment). This is expected and doesn't affect functionality.
