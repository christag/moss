**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 & Phase 2 Complete âœ…

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive RBAC admin panel enhancements including audit logging, assignment editing, role templates, and hierarchy visualization.

---

## Phase 1: Core Functionality âœ… COMPLETE

### 1. Permission Audit Logging
**Files Modified**: 6 API route files
- `/api/roles/route.ts` - Role creation logging
- `/api/roles/[id]/route.ts` - Role update/deletion logging with before/after values
- `/api/role-assignments/route.ts` - Assignment creation logging
- `/api/role-assignments/[id]/route.ts` - Assignment update/revocation logging
- `/api/roles/[id]/permissions/route.ts` - Permission changes logging

**Features**:
- Logs all RBAC operations to `admin_audit_log` table
- Captures user ID, IP address, user agent, and timestamps
- Records before/after values for updates
- Tracks added/removed permissions with counts
- Category: `rbac` for easy filtering

**Actions Logged**:
- `role_created`
- `role_updated`
- `role_deleted`
- `role_assignment_created`
- `role_assignment_updated`
- `role_assignment_revoked`
- `role_permissions_updated`

### 2. Edit Role Assignment Modal
**File Created**: `src/components/EditRoleAssignmentModal.tsx` (400+ lines)

**Features**:
- Edit assignment scope (global, location, specific_objects)
- Multi-select location checkboxes for location-scoped assignments
- Edit notes field
- Pre-populated with current assignment data
- Full validation with error messages
- Visual indicators for selected scope

### 3. Role Templates Seed Data
**File Created**: `seeds/004_role_templates.sql` (220+ lines)

**5 IT-Specific Roles**:

1. **IT Admin** (`00000000-0000-0000-000a-000000000010`)
   - Full access to IT infrastructure objects
   - Devices, networks, IOs, IP addresses, software, licenses
   - View/edit access to people, groups, locations, rooms
   - View-only for companies

## Phase 2: Hierarchy Visualization âœ… COMPLETE

### 1. RoleHierarchyTree Component
**File Created**: `src/components/RoleHierarchyTree.tsx` (450+ lines)

**Features**:
- Tree structure displaying parent-child role relationships
- Visual connector lines showing inheritance paths
- Permission counts for each role:
  - Direct permissions (explicitly assigned)
  - Inherited permissions (from parent roles)
  - Total permissions

### 3. Navigation Integration
**File Modified**: `src/app/admin/rbac/roles/page.tsx`

**Changes**:

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Apply role template seed data (optional)
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -U postgres -d moss -f seeds/004_role_templates.sql
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

## Database Queries for Verification

### Check Audit Log Entries
```sql
-- View recent RBAC audit entries
SELECT
  aal.action,
  aal.target_type,
  aal.target_id,
  aal.details,
  p.full_name as user_name,
  aal.created_at
FROM admin_audit_log aal
LEFT JOIN users u ON aal.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN people p ON u.person_id = p.id
WHERE aal.category = 'rbac'
ORDER BY aal.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Role Templates (if seeded)
```sql
-- View role templates with permission counts
SELECT
  r.role_name,
  r.description,
  r.is_system_role,
  COUNT(rp.permission_id) as direct_permissions
FROM roles r
LEFT JOIN role_permissions rp ON r.id = rp.role_id
WHERE r.id LIKE '00000000-0000-0000-000a-0000000000%'
GROUP BY r.id, r.role_name, r.description, r.is_system_role
ORDER BY r.role_name;
```

### Check Role Hierarchy
```sql
-- View role parent-child relationships
SELECT
  child.role_name as child_role,
  parent.role_name as parent_role,
  child.description
FROM roles child
LEFT JOIN roles parent ON child.parent_role_id = parent.id
WHERE child.parent_role_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY parent.role_name, child.role_name;
```

## API Endpoints Enhanced

### Audit Logging Added
- `POST /api/roles` - Logs role creation
- `PATCH /api/roles/:id` - Logs role updates with before/after
- `DELETE /api/roles/:id` - Logs role deletion
- `POST /api/role-assignments` - Logs assignment creation
- `PATCH /api/role-assignments/:id` - Logs assignment updates
- `DELETE /api/role-assignments/:id` - Logs assignment revocation
- `PUT /api/roles/:id/permissions` - Logs permission changes

### Existing Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/roles` - Fetches all roles for hierarchy
- `GET /api/roles/:id/permissions?include_inherited=true` - Fetches permission counts

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 6)

### Remaining Items (Deferred)
1. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Rules based on user attributes, object attributes, and context
   - More granular than RBAC alone
   - Examples: "Managers can edit people in their department", "Users can only edit their own profile"

2. **Permission Groups**
   - Group related permissions for bulk assignment
   - Examples: "Device Management" = device view/edit/delete
   - Saves time when assigning common permission sets

3. **Playwright E2E Tests**
   - Automated testing of full RBAC workflows
   - Test role creation, assignment, editing, revocation
   - Test hierarchy visualization and navigation
   - Verify audit logging functionality

---

## How to Use

### For Administrators
1. **View Role Hierarchy**: Navigate to RBAC â†’ Roles â†’ "View Hierarchy"
2. **Edit Assignments**: Go to RBAC â†’ Assignments â†’ Click "Edit" on any assignment
3. **Apply Role Templates**: Run the seed script to get IT-specific roles
4. **Audit Trail**: Query `admin_audit_log` table to see all RBAC changes

### For Developers
1. **Extend Audit Logging**: Use `logAdminAction()` helper function
2. **Create Custom Roles**: Use role templates as examples
3. **Build on Hierarchy Tree**: Component supports custom click handlers
4. **Add More Visualizations**: Tree component is reusable
