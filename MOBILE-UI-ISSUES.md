## Critical Issues

### 1. Admin Panel - Horizontal Overflow and Visibility Issues
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `/admin` and all admin sub-pages  
**Issue**: The admin panel uses a fixed sidebar layout that doesn't adapt to mobile screens. The sidebar takes up approximately 250px of horizontal space, causing the main content area to be squeezed and requiring horizontal scrolling to view and interact with content.

**Screenshots**:

- `mobile-admin-scrolled.png`

**Recommendation**: Implement a mobile-specific layout for the admin panel:
- Hide the sidebar by default on mobile
- Add a hamburger menu or drawer to access admin navigation
- Make the main content area full-width on mobile devices
- Consider using a bottom navigation bar or floating action button for quick access

### 2. Action Buttons Positioned Too Far Right (All List Pages)
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `/devices`, `/people`, `/networks`, `/companies`, and all other list pages  
**Issue**: Primary action buttons (e.g., "Add Device", "Add Person", "Add Network", "Add Company") are positioned in the top-right corner and extend beyond the mobile viewport, requiring horizontal scrolling to access. The "Columns" button is also partially cut off.

**Affected Pages**:
- Devices page: "Add Device" button off-screen
- People page: "Add Person" button off-screen
- Networks page: "Add Network" button off-screen
- Companies page: "Add Company" button off-screen

**Screenshots**:
- `mobile-devices-page.png` (before scroll)
- `mobile-devices-page-scrolled.png` (after scroll)
- `mobile-networks-page.png` (before scroll)
- `mobile-networks-scrolled.png` (after scroll)
- `mobile-people-page.png`
- `mobile-companies-page.png`

**Recommendation**:
- Stack buttons vertically on mobile or move them below the search bar
- Use a floating action button (FAB) for the primary "Add" action
- Move "Export" and "Columns" buttons to a more accessible location (e.g., dropdown menu or bottom sheet)
- Ensure all interactive elements are within the viewport without horizontal scrolling

### 3. Navigation Menu - Font Size Too Small
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: Mobile navigation menu (hamburger menu)  
**Issue**: Secondary descriptive text in the mobile navigation menu is too small and difficult to read. Text like "Vendors & manufacturers", "Buildings & sites", "Hardware & equipment", "Device & user groups", "VLANs & subnets", etc., appears in a very small font size (appears to be around 11-12px).

**Screenshots**:
- `mobile-menu-open.png`
- `mobile-menu-scrolled.png`

**Recommendation**:
- Increase the font size of secondary/descriptive text to at least 13-14px
- Consider removing the descriptive text entirely on mobile to simplify the menu
- Increase line height and padding between menu items for better touch targets
- Ensure minimum touch target size of 44x44px for all menu items

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Page Headings - Inconsistent Font Sizing
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: Various pages  
**Issue**: Page headings (h1) appear oversized on some pages, while smaller text elements (like user email in dropdown) are too small. This creates an inconsistent visual hierarchy and reduces readability.

**Examples**:
- Company detail page: "Test Company" heading is very large (appears 2.5-3rem)
- User menu dropdown: "admin@moss.local" is very small
- Section headings: "Basic Information", "Additional Information" are quite large

**Screenshots**:
- `mobile-company-detail.png`
- `mobile-user-menu-open.png`

**Recommendation**:
- Establish a consistent typography scale for mobile:
  - H1: 1.75-2rem (28-32px)
  - H2: 1.5rem (24px)
  - H3: 1.25rem (20px)
  - Body: 1rem (16px)
  - Small/secondary: 0.875rem (14px)
- Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards for readability
- Test with different iOS/Android system font sizes

---

### 5. Data Tables - Horizontal Overflow
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: All table views (`/people`, `/companies`, `/devices`, etc.)  
**Issue**: Data tables extend beyond the mobile viewport width, requiring horizontal scrolling to view all columns. This makes it difficult to scan and interact with table data on mobile devices.

**Screenshots**:
- `mobile-people-page.png`
- `mobile-companies-page.png`

**Recommendation**:
- Implement a mobile-optimized table view:
  - Use card-based layout instead of tables on mobile
  - Show only essential columns by default
  - Add expand/collapse functionality for additional details
  - Consider a list view with stackable information
- Make column filters accessible without horizontal scrolling
- Add swipe gestures for quick actions

---

### 6. Tab Navigation - Horizontal Overflow
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: Detail pages (e.g., company detail `/companies/[id]`)  
**Issue**: Tab navigation (Overview, Locations, People, Devices, Contracts, Attachments, History) extends beyond viewport width. While there is a scroll indicator, the tabs are not fully visible and require scrolling.

**Screenshots**:
- `mobile-company-detail.png`

**Recommendation**:
- Implement scrollable tabs with clear visual indicators
- Add scroll buttons or snap-scrolling behavior
- Consider using a dropdown menu for secondary tabs
- Reduce padding/margins on tab buttons for mobile
- Use icons with labels for better space utilization

---

## Minor Issues

### 7. Search Bar - Slightly Compressed
**Severity**: Low  
**Location**: Top navigation bar  
**Issue**: The global search box in the header is slightly compressed between the hamburger menu and user menu icons.

**Recommendation**:
- Give search bar more horizontal space on mobile
- Consider making search full-width when focused
- Add a dedicated search page/screen accessible from navigation

---

### 8. Form Labels and Inputs - Adequate but Could Improve
**Severity**: Low  
**Location**: Form pages (e.g., `/people/new`)  
**Issue**: Forms are functional but could benefit from mobile-specific optimizations.

**Screenshots**:
- `mobile-add-person-form.png`
- `mobile-add-person-form-scrolled.png`
- `mobile-add-person-form-bottom.png`

**Recommendation**:
- Ensure proper input types for mobile keyboards (tel, email, url, etc.)
- Add autocomplete attributes where appropriate
- Consider grouping related fields in collapsible sections
- Use native mobile date/time pickers
- Increase spacing between form fields for better touch interaction

## Positive Observations

### What Works Well on Mobile:
1. **Setup Wizard**: The setup process works well on mobile with appropriate sizing and clear progression
2. **Dashboard Cards**: The dashboard widget cards stack nicely on mobile
3. **Login Page**: Clean, centered layout that works well on mobile devices
4. **Form Inputs**: Form inputs are appropriately sized and labeled
5. **Quick Actions**: Button styling and sizing is generally good
6. **Color Contrast**: Good color contrast throughout the application

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on Real Devices**: This review was conducted on a simulated mobile viewport. Testing on actual iOS and Android devices is recommended to catch device-specific issues.

2. **Different Screen Sizes**: Test on various mobile screen sizes:
   - Small phones (320-375px width)
   - Standard phones (375-414px width)
   - Large phones (414-480px width)
   - Tablets in portrait mode (768px width)

3. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Test with iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack
   - Verify minimum touch target sizes (44x44px)
   - Test with system font size adjustments
   - Verify color contrast ratios

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test on slower mobile connections
   - Verify image optimization for mobile
   - Check JavaScript bundle sizes

5. **Orientation Testing**:
   - Test in both portrait and landscape orientations
   - Verify responsive behavior during orientation changes
