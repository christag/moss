# M.O.S.S.

**Material Organization & Storage System**

An open-source IT asset management and documentation platform for comprehensive hardware, software, and network infrastructure tracking.

---

## Overview

M.O.S.S. is a modern alternative to other IT inventory products, built specifically for IT departments managing complex infrastructure including traditional IT equipment, broadcast/AV systems, and cloud services. It provides a single source of truth for all IT assets, their relationships, and documentation.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Asset Tracking**: Manage devices, software, SaaS services, licenses, and contracts
- **Network Topology Mapping**: Visualize network infrastructure from physical interface relationships
- **Universal Interface Model**: Track all connection types (network, broadcast, power, data) in a single unified system
- **Relationship-First Design**: Maintain complex relationships between devices, people, software, networks, and locations
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions with global, location-based, and object-specific scoping
- **Modular Equipment Support**: Parent-child relationships for chassis-based systems with independent warranty tracking
- **Admin Settings Panel**: Comprehensive system configuration dashboard for branding, authentication, storage, integrations, and more

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **For Docker Deployment** (Recommended):
  - Docker 20.10+
  - Docker Compose 2.0+

- **For Development**:
  - PostgreSQL 14+
  - Node.js 18+
  - Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Docker Deployment (Production)

Deploy using pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moss.git
cd moss

# Create production environment file
cp .env.production.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your settings (see Docker Deployment Guide)

# Pull and start services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production up -d

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f app
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured domain).

📚 **Full Docker Deployment Guide**: See [docs/docker-deployment.md](docs/docker-deployment.md) for complete instructions including:
- Using pre-built images from GHCR
- Environment configuration
- Reverse proxy setup
- Backup and restore
- Upgrading and monitoring

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moss.git
cd moss

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment (optional - defaults work for local PostgreSQL)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials if needed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

On first launch, visit `/setup` to complete the initialization wizard. The setup will:
1. Automatically create the database
2. Create all tables and schema
3. Guide you through creating your admin account
4. Set up your primary organization

**No manual database setup required!** The setup wizard handles everything automatically.

---

## Core Concepts

### Universal IO Object

All interfaces, ports, and connectors are tracked through a single `ios` table that handles:
- **Network**: Ethernet, fiber, WiFi with VLAN tagging support
- **Broadcast**: SDI, HDMI, XLR, Coax for AV equipment
- **Power**: AC/DC inputs and outputs for power topology
- **Data**: USB, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort connections

This unified approach enables comprehensive topology mapping across different connection types.

### Template-Driven UI

Rather than unique screens for each object type, M.O.S.S. uses three reusable templates:
- **Generic List View**: Browse and filter any standard object type
- **Generic Detail View**: View/edit complete information with relationship tabs
- **Generic Form**: Create or edit any standard object

Specialized views are only created for unique workflows (network topology, IP management, RBAC configuration).

### Modular Equipment

Devices can have parent-child relationships to represent:
- Chassis-based systems (switches with line cards, blade servers)
- Rack-mounted equipment with independent modules
- Each child module maintains its own warranty, serial number, and lifecycle data

---
