### Additional Observations

1. **~~Company Form Issue~~**: ✅ **FIXED** - Company Type dropdown now defaults to "Vendor" on create form. No validation error on initial load.
   - **Fix Applied**: Modified `src/components/forms/CompanyForm.tsx` to set default `company_type: 'vendor'` in initialValues for create mode.
   - **Verification**: Screenshot `company-form-initial-state.png` shows "Vendor" pre-selected.

2. **~~Room Form Submission~~**: ✅ **FIXED** - Room creation now redirects properly to room detail page after successful submission.
   - **Root Cause**: Field name mismatch - form used `name` but API schema expected `room_name`.
   - **Fix Applied**: Modified `src/components/RoomForm.tsx` to change field name from `name` to `room_name` (line 56).
   - **Verification**: Created "Test Room Redirect Fix" - successfully redirected to `/rooms/29cddf4f-9707-4b2c-bcf7-202ccfa3c851`. Screenshot `room-redirect-fix-success.png` shows room detail page.

3. **Performance**: All dropdowns loaded within 2 seconds. API responses fast. No performance issues observed.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome via Playwright. All features work as expected.
