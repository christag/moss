## Defects Found

### DEF-ROUND2-AG2-001: Dashboard Widgets Returning 500 Errors
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Object**: Dashboard
**Test**: Environment Verification - Dashboard Access
**Description**: Three dashboard widgets (Expiring Warranties, Expiring Licenses, Expiring Contracts) display "Error: Failed to fetch items"
**Expected**: Widgets should display data or show empty state
**Actual**: Error messages displayed with console showing 500 Internal Server Error
**Screenshot**: testing/agent2-02-dashboard-success.png
**Console Errors**:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
```
**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Log in as testadmin@moss.local
2. Navigate to dashboard (/)
3. Observe three widgets at bottom showing error state

**Impact**: Non-blocking - does not prevent CRUD operations on any objects. Dashboard still shows quick stats correctly.
**Priority**: Medium - Should be fixed but doesn't block launch
**Suggested Fix**: Check API endpoints for `/api/dashboard/expiring-warranties`, `/api/dashboard/expiring-licenses`, and `/api/dashboard/expiring-contracts`

---

### DEF-ROUND2-AG2-002: TESTING.md Documentation Outdated
**Severity**: LOW
**Object**: Documentation
**Test**: Environment Verification - Login
**Description**: TESTING.md documents incorrect test credentials
**Expected**: Documentation shows correct credentials: testadmin@moss.local / password
**Actual**: TESTING.md shows: admin@test.com / admin123 (these credentials don't exist)
**Impact**: Confusing for testers, delays testing start
**Priority**: Low - Documentation issue only
**Suggested Fix**: Update TESTING.md lines 119-123 with correct credentials from scripts/create-all-test-users.ts

## Testing Approach Note

Due to time constraints with 112 total tests (16 objects × 7 tests), the full test suite execution is proceeding systematically. This report documents completed testing for the Companies object. Additional objects will follow the same comprehensive 7-test pattern.

**Status**: Testing in progress - Companies complete (7/7), 15 objects remaining (105 tests pending)

---

## Next Steps

### Remaining Objects to Test (15):
1. Locations (7 tests)
2. Rooms (7 tests)
3. People (7 tests)
4. Devices (7 tests)
5. Groups (7 tests)
6. Networks (7 tests)
7. IOs (7 tests)
8. IP Addresses (7 tests)
9. Software (7 tests)
10. SaaS Services (7 tests)
11. Installed Applications (7 tests)
12. Software Licenses (7 tests)
13. Documents (7 tests)
14. External Documents (7 tests)
15. Contracts (7 tests)

### Recommended Priority
- **HIGH**: Complete testing for core objects (Locations, People, Devices, Networks)
- **MEDIUM**: Test service-related objects (Software, SaaS Services, Licenses)
- **LOW**: Test support objects (Documents, External Documents, Contracts, IOs, IP Addresses)

---

## Launch Recommendation

**Decision**: CONDITIONAL GO (based on Companies testing only)

**Justification**:
- **Setup wizard blocker RESOLVED** - Major Round 1 issue fixed
- Companies object: 100% pass rate (7/7 tests)
- Zero critical defects in tested functionality
- CRUD operations fully functional for Companies
- UI patterns consistent and user-friendly

**Blocking Issues**: NONE (for Companies object)

**Non-Blocking Issues**:
- MEDIUM: Dashboard widgets returning 500 errors (doesn't block CRUD)
- LOW: TESTING.md documentation outdated (doesn't affect functionality)

**Recommendation for Full Launch**: Continue testing remaining 15 objects to ensure comprehensive coverage before final GO decision.

**Current Confidence Level**: HIGH for Companies object, pending verification of other 15 objects.
