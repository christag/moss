## Executive Summary

**Testing Status**: BLOCKED - Critical Application Issues

**Total Tests Planned**: 75
**Tests Executed**: 10
**Tests Passed**: 2
**Tests Failed**: 0
**Tests Blocked**: 8
**Pass Rate**: N/A (insufficient tests due to blocking issues)

### Critical Blocker

The M.O.S.S. application experienced severe runtime errors during testing that prevented execution of most integration tests. The application exhibited:

1. Next.js build errors related to missing webpack-runtime.js
2. Invalid route parameter types in admin integration routes
3. Server instability requiring multiple restarts
4. API endpoints returning HTML error pages instead of JSON responses
5. Intermittent failures across all POST endpoints

**Recommendation**: Application requires immediate stabilization before integration testing can proceed. The core CRUD functionality that integration tests depend on is not reliably functional.

---

## Test Environment

- **Application Server**: Next.js 15.5.4 (development mode)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (connected via pool)
- **Server Ports Tested**: 3000, 3001, 3003
- **Testing Method**: curl via Bash, direct HTTP API calls
- **Database State**: Contains seed data from previous testing

## Defects Discovered

### DEF-UAT-INT-001: Application Instability Prevents Integration Testing

**Severity**: Critical (Blocker)
**Priority**: P0
**Component**: Next.js Application / API Routes
**Status**: Open

**Summary**:
The M.O.S.S. application exhibits severe instability that prevents execution of integration and relationship testing. API endpoints return HTML error pages instead of JSON responses.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Start Next.js dev server with `npm run dev`
2. Attempt to POST to /api/companies or other POST endpoints
3. Observe HTML error page response instead of JSON

**Expected Behavior**:
- API endpoints should return JSON responses
- Server should remain stable across multiple requests
- POST operations should create records and return success/failure JSON

**Actual Behavior**:
- API endpoints intermittently return HTML with "missing required error components, refreshing..."
- Multiple server restarts required during testing session
- Inconsistent behavior across identical requests
- GET endpoints work initially but fail after POST attempts

**Environment**:
- Next.js: 15.5.4
- Node.js: Latest LTS
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.0.0)
- Development mode

**Error Messages Observed**:
```
Cannot find module '../webpack-runtime.js'
missing required error components, refreshing...
```

**Impact**:
- Blocks ALL integration testing (75 tests)
- Blocks relationship verification
- Blocks junction table testing
- Blocks cascade behavior testing
- Prevents validation of core application functionality

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Investigate Next.js build configuration
2. Check for missing dependencies or build artifacts
3. Review recent changes to route handlers
4. Verify TypeScript route parameter types (admin integration routes error noted)
5. Consider clean rebuild of entire application
6. Verify .next directory is not corrupted

**Workaround**: None - application must be stabilized before testing can proceed

**Related Logs**:
```
Type error: Route "src/app/api/admin/integrations/[id]/route.ts" has an invalid "GET" export
```

---

### DEF-UAT-INT-002: Room Creation Validation Error Messages Not Returned

**Severity**: Minor
**Priority**: P3
**Component**: /api/rooms POST endpoint
**Status**: Open

**Summary**:
When room creation fails due to invalid location_id, the API returns only `{"success": false}` without an error message explaining the failure reason.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. POST to /api/rooms with invalid location_id
2. Observe response

**Expected Behavior**:
- Response should include error message: `{"success": false, "message": "Location not found"}` or validation details

**Actual Behavior**:
- Response: `{"success": false}` only
- Status code: 400

**Impact**:
- Reduced debuggability for API consumers
- Harder to distinguish between validation errors and location not found errors

**Code Reference**: /Users/admin/Dev/moss/src/app/api/rooms/route.ts line 128
- The code includes proper error message but it may not be reaching the response

---

## Environment Issues

### Issue 1: Multiple Next.js Dev Servers Running

**Observation**: During testing, multiple Next.js dev servers were found running simultaneously on different ports (3000, 3001, 3003).

**Impact**:
- Port conflicts
- Unclear which server is handling requests
- Potential for stale code serving

**Resolution Attempted**: Killed all processes and restarted single instance

---

### Issue 2: Build Errors During Testing

**Observation**: Next.js build command failed with TypeScript errors in admin integration routes.

**Error**:
```
Type error: Route "src/app/api/admin/integrations/[id]/route.ts" has an invalid "GET" export:
  Type "{ params: { id: string; }; }" is not a valid type for the function's second argument.
```

**Impact**:
- Production build would fail
- Development mode compensates but may have runtime issues
- Indicates potential routing architecture issues

**Recommendation**: Fix TypeScript types in route handlers to match Next.js 15 parameter structure

---

## Integration Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Foreign Key Validation Inconsistency

**Observation**: The rooms API validates that location_id exists before insertion (line 126-129 of route.ts), which is correct. However, the error response lacks the detailed message.

**Impact**: Minor - functionality works but error messaging suboptimal

**Recommendation**: Ensure all API routes return consistent error response format with detailed messages

---

### Issue 2: ID Extraction from API Responses

**Observation**: When testing programmatically, extracting IDs from responses requires accessing `.data.id` not just `.id`.

**Impact**: None - this is correct API design (envelope pattern)

**Note**: Test scripts must use `jq -r '.data.id'` not `jq -r '.id'`

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **CRITICAL**: Stabilize the Next.js application
   - Fix webpack-runtime.js error
   - Resolve admin integrations route TypeScript errors
   - Ensure server remains stable across requests
   - Verify all API routes return JSON not HTML

2. **HIGH**: Complete build verification
   - Run `npm run build` and resolve all TypeScript errors
   - Run `npm run lint` and resolve all linting errors
   - Ensure production build succeeds

3. **HIGH**: Server management
   - Document proper server start/stop procedures
   - Implement port conflict detection
   - Add health check monitoring

### Testing Process Improvements

1. **Setup automated testing infrastructure**
   - Use Jest/Vitest for API integration tests
   - Implement proper test database with migrations
   - Add transaction rollback for test isolation

2. **Implement comprehensive error logging**
   - Add request ID tracking
   - Log all API errors with stack traces
   - Implement structured logging

3. **Add API response validation**
   - Validate all responses against OpenAPI schema
   - Ensure consistent error response format
   - Add response time monitoring

### Future Testing

Once application is stable:

1. Re-run all blocked tests systematically
2. Add additional edge case testing
3. Implement load testing for junction tables
4. Test cascade behavior with large datasets
5. Verify circular reference prevention
6. Test concurrent operations and race conditions

## Conclusion

Integration and relationship testing for M.O.S.S. application could not be completed due to critical application instability issues. The application requires immediate attention to resolve build errors, server instability, and API routing problems before comprehensive integration testing can proceed.

The limited testing that was possible (room creation with valid/invalid location_id) demonstrated that the underlying database relationships and validation logic appear to be correctly implemented. However, the application's runtime environment is too unstable to verify the majority of integration test scenarios.

**Recommendation**: Halt all UAT testing until DEF-UAT-INT-001 is resolved and the application achieves stable operation in development mode.
