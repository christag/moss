### Phase 2: Advanced Features

#### 2.1 Network Topology Visualization
**Goal**: Interactive network diagrams showing physical and logical connectivity via IO relationships

**Research Summary**: Cytoscape.js is optimal for graph-based network topologies with built-in algorithms and React integration. D3.js offers more customization but requires significantly more development time. WebGL rendering (via Cytoscape.js or Sigma.js) is essential for large graphs with 1000+ nodes.

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Choose visualization library
  - [ ] Evaluate Cytoscape.js vs D3.js for network graph use cases
  - [ ] Test react-cytoscapejs wrapper with sample data
  - [ ] Verify performance with 500+ nodes (typical network size)
  - [ ] Decision: Recommend Cytoscape.js for built-in layouts and graph algorithms
- [ ] Design topology data model
  - [ ] Create API endpoint `/api/topology/network` to fetch IO connectivity chains
  - [ ] Query: `ios` table with `connected_to_io_id` relationships
  - [ ] Return nodes (devices with IOs) and edges (IO-to-IO connections)
  - [ ] Include node metadata: device type, location, status
  - [ ] Include edge metadata: interface type, speed, VLAN, media type
- [ ] Build topology visualization component
  - [ ] Create `NetworkTopologyView.tsx` with Cytoscape.js integration
  - [ ] Implement force-directed layout (default) with manual node positioning
  - [ ] Add zoom/pan controls with mouse wheel and drag gestures
  - [ ] Display node labels (device names) with hover tooltips (full details)
  - [ ] Color-code nodes by device type (switch, router, server, etc.)
  - [ ] Color-code edges by interface type (ethernet=blue, fiber=green, power=orange)
- [ ] Add interactive features
  - [ ] Click node → open device detail page in sidebar panel
  - [ ] Click edge → show IO connection details (speed, duplex, VLAN)
  - [ ] Double-click node → expand to show all IOs on that device
  - [ ] Right-click → context menu (edit device, view IOs, trace path)
  - [ ] Highlight path: Select two nodes → show shortest path via BFS algorithm
- [ ] Implement filtering and search
  - [ ] Filter by location (show only devices in selected location)

  - [ ] Create `SubnetVisualization.tsx` component with grid-based IP display
  - [ ] Show /24 subnet as 16x16 grid (256 addresses)
  - [ ] Color-code: allocated (green), reserved (blue), DHCP pool (yellow), available (gray)
  - [ ] Click IP → show assignment details (device, IO, hostname)
  - [ ] Hover → show IP details (status, last seen, MAC address)
- [ ] Implement CIDR calculator
  - [ ] Create `CIDRCalculator.tsx` utility component
  - [ ] Input: IP address + CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
  - [ ] Calculate: Network address, broadcast address, usable range, subnet mask
  - [ ] Calculate: Number of hosts, first IP, last IP, wildcard mask
  - [ ] Support IPv4 and IPv6 (separate calculators or toggle)
  - [ ] "Apply to Network" button → create network record from calculation
- [ ] Add subnet hierarchy view
  - [ ] Tree view showing supernets → subnets → IP blocks
  - [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorganize subnets (update `networks.parent_network_id`)
  - [ ] Expand/collapse branches to show/hide child subnets
  - [ ] Show utilization percentage per subnet (allocated / total)
  - [ ] Highlight conflicts (overlapping subnet ranges)
- [ ] Implement conflict detection
  - [ ] API endpoint `/api/ip-addresses/conflicts` to find duplicates
  - [ ] Query: Find IPs with same address on different IOs (data integrity issue)
  - [ ] Query: Find IPs outside network range (configuration error)
  - [ ] Query: Find IPs in DHCP range but statically assigned (potential conflict)
  - [ ] UI: Conflicts page with filterable table and resolution actions
- [ ] Build IP allocation wizard

- [ ] Add utilization reporting
  - [ ] Dashboard widget: "Top 10 Most Utilized Subnets"
  - [ ] Per-network utilization chart (pie or donut chart)
  - [ ] Utilization trend over time (requires historical data tracking)
  - [ ] Alert: Subnet approaching capacity (>80% or >90% threshold)
- [ ] IPv6 support
  - [ ] Extend `ip_addresses` table to support IPv6 (already has `ip_version` enum)
  - [ ] IPv6 CIDR calculator (support /64, /48, etc.)

#### 2.5 Enhanced RBAC - **IN PROGRESS** (Started 2025-10-12)
**Goal**: Hierarchical roles with attribute-based permissions, object-level overrides, and location scoping

**Research Summary**: Core RBAC (roles + permissions) is sufficient for basic needs. Hierarchical RBAC adds role inheritance (e.g., Manager inherits Employee permissions).

  - [x] Cache permission checks with 5-minute TTL (avoid repeated database queries)
  - [x] Invalidate cache when role assignments or permissions change
  - [x] Validation: Prevent circular role hierarchies with `checkRoleHierarchyCycle()`
