## üö® CURRENT PRIORITY: UAT Defect Remediation (2025-10-10)

### UAT Test Results Summary
- **Overall Pass Rate: 20.8%** (10 passed out of 48 scenarios tested)
- **Blocked: 54.2%** (26 scenarios blocked by systemic issues)
- **Failed: 16.7%** (8 scenarios failed)
- **Working Features**: Companies (partial), Locations (partial), People (100%), Groups (100%), Networks (100%)
- **Blocked Features**: Devices, IOs, IP Addresses, SaaS Services, Software, Installed Apps, Licenses, Documents

### Phase 1: Critical Systemic Fixes (PRIORITY 1 - Unblocks 26 scenarios)

#### 1.1 DEF-007: Null Fields Handling (CRITICAL - Blocks 7 features) ‚úÖ COMPLETE + TESTED
**Status**: üü¢ **FIXED & VERIFIED**
**Impact**: Blocks SaaS Services, Software, Installed Apps, Licenses, Documents (20+ scenarios)
**Tasks**:
- [x] Fix SaaSServiceForm.tsx - Remove null submission for 13 optional fields
- [x] Fix SoftwareForm.tsx - Fix optional field handling
- [x] Fix InstalledApplicationForm.tsx - Fix optional field handling
- [x] Fix SoftwareLicenseForm.tsx - Fix optional field handling
- [x] Fix DocumentForm.tsx - Fix optional field handling
- [x] Test create operations for all 5 features ‚úÖ **ALL PASSED**
- [x] Verify optional fields are omitted (not null) in API requests ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**

**Testing Results** (2025-10-10):
- ‚úÖ SaaS Services: Created "Test SaaS Service - DEF-007" - 201 success
- ‚úÖ Software: Created "Test Software - DEF-007" - 201 success
- ‚úÖ Installed Applications: Created "Test App - DEF-007" - 201 success, navigated to detail
- ‚úÖ Software Licenses: Created with no fields filled - 201 success, navigated to detail
- ‚úÖ Documents: Created "Test Document - DEF-007" - 201 success, redirected to list

**Solution Implemented**: Changed all 5 forms to build request body dynamically, only including fields with values. Empty/null optional fields are now omitted entirely from the JSON payload instead of being sent as `null`, which matches API expectations.

#### 1.2 DEF-005/DEF-004: API Limit Parameter (CRITICAL - Blocks 7 scenarios) ‚úÖ COMPLETE + TESTED
**Status**: üü¢ **FIXED & VERIFIED**
**Impact**: Blocks Devices and IOs features
**Tasks**:
- [x] Identify current limit value in DeviceForm dropdown API calls (was 200)
- [x] Fix DeviceForm.tsx location dropdown API call (200 ‚Üí 100)
- [x] Fix DeviceForm.tsx parent device dropdown API call (200 ‚Üí 100)
- [x] Fix IOForm.tsx IOs dropdown API call (200 ‚Üí 100)
- [x] Test device creation with dropdowns populated ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**
- [x] Test IO creation with device dropdown populated ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**

**Testing Results** (2025-10-10):
- ‚úÖ Device Form: All dropdowns loaded successfully with limit=100
  - Locations: 6 options, 200 response in 384ms
  - Companies: 7 options, 200 response
  - Rooms: 9 options, 200 response in 210ms
  - People: 17 options, 200 response
- ‚úÖ IO Form: All dropdowns loaded successfully with limit=100
  - Devices: API call succeeded (200 response in 245ms)
  - Rooms: 100 options loaded (200 response in 210ms)
  - Networks: 2 options loaded (Corp-LAN, Guest-WiFi) - 200 response in 151ms
  - IOs: API call succeeded (200 response in 270ms)

**Root Cause**: Different endpoints have different max limits:
- `max(200)`: companies, people, rooms
- `max(100)`: devices, locations, groups, IOs, networks, and most other endpoints

**Solution Implemented**: Reduced limit from 200 to 100 for:
- DeviceForm: locations dropdown, parent devices dropdown
- IOForm: devices dropdown, rooms dropdown, networks dropdown, IOs dropdown (connected_to_io_id)

**Evidence from Server Logs**:
- Before fix: `GET /api/locations?limit=200` returned 400 error
- After fix: `GET /api/locations?limit=100` returned 200 success in 384ms
- Before fix: `GET /api/devices?device_type=chassis&limit=200` returned 500 error
- After fix: All API calls with limit=100 returned 200 success

- [x] Test delete with dependencies (should fail with clear message) ‚úÖ **PASSED**
- [x] Test delete without dependencies (should succeed) ‚úÖ **PASSED**

**Testing Results** (2025-10-10):
- ‚úÖ **Delete Button**: Present on company detail page with confirmation dialog
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Checking**: API checks for locations, people, software, and contracts
- ‚úÖ **Test with Dependencies**:
  - Attempted to delete "Test Integration Inc" (has 1 location)
  - Got alert: "This company has 1 location(s) linked to it. Please remove or reassign these records first."
  - API returned 409 Conflict status
  - Company was NOT deleted (correct behavior)
- ‚úÖ **Test without Dependencies**:
  - Created "DELETE TEST Company" with no dependencies
  - Delete succeeded with confirmation dialog
  - Redirected to companies list
  - Company successfully removed from database

**Implementation Details**:
- Delete endpoint in src/app/api/companies/[id]/route.ts (lines 203-276)
- Checks 4 dependency types: locations, people, software, contracts

**Conclusion**: DEF-001 was already fully implemented and working correctly. No fixes needed.

#### 2.2 DEF-003: Room Creation API Mismatch ‚úÖ COMPLETE + ENHANCED
**Status**: üü¢ **NO MISMATCH FOUND - FORM ENHANCED**
**Tasks**:
- [x] Review RoomForm field names vs API expectations ‚úÖ **ALIGNED**
- [x] Check src/app/api/rooms/route.ts POST parameter validation ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**
- [x] Align form submission with API requirements ‚úÖ **ALREADY ALIGNED**
- [x] Test room creation end-to-end ‚úÖ **PASSED**
- [x] Add missing optional fields to form ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Testing Results** (2025-10-10):
- ‚úÖ **Field Name Alignment**: All form field names match API expectations perfectly
  - room_name ‚úì, location_id ‚úì, room_type ‚úì, floor ‚úì, capacity ‚úì, access_requirements ‚úì
- ‚úÖ **Room Creation Test**: Successfully created "DEF-003 Test Room"
  - Form submitted with room_name and location_id (required fields)
  - API returned 201 Created
  - Redirected to detail page showing room data correctly
  - Room ID: f6fb2b4e-5d0b-4787-a7e6-1d99367313b6

**Enhancement Made**:
- Added 2 missing optional fields to RoomForm:
  - `room_number` (e.g., "101", "DC-01", "B1-05")
  - `notes` (for additional information)
- Updated initialValues for edit mode to include new fields
- Form now has all 8 fields that the API accepts

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/RoomForm.tsx (added room_number and notes fields)

**Conclusion**: DEF-003 was a false alarm - no API mismatch existed. Room creation was already working correctly. Enhanced the form by adding two optional fields that were missing.

- [x] Test invalid IP formats are rejected (999.999.999.999) ‚úÖ TESTED - WORKING
- [x] Test valid IPs are accepted (10.10.100.50) ‚úÖ TESTED - WORKING (after fixing null fields bug)

**Test Results** (2025-10-10):
1. **Schema Validation Review** (src/lib/schemas/ip-address.ts):
   - IPv4 regex validation already implemented (validates 0-255 for each octet, lines 11-12)
   - IPv6 regex validation already implemented (handles full and compressed notation, lines 15-16)
   - CreateIPAddressSchema has `.refine()` validation (lines 18-45)
   - UpdateIPAddressSchema has `.refine()` validation (lines 47-77)
   - Auto-detects IP version from format if not specified

2. **Client-Side Validation Test** (Invalid IP: 999.999.999.999):
   - Navigated to IP Addresses page ‚Üí "Add IP Address"
   - Entered invalid IP: 999.999.999.999
   - Result: ‚úÖ Error displayed: "Invalid IPv4 address format. Example: 192.168.1.1"
   - Submit button disabled when validation error present
   - Client-side validation working correctly

3. **Server-Side Validation Test** (Valid IP: 10.10.100.50):
   - Attempted to create valid IP: 10.10.100.50
   - Initial Result: ‚ùå 400 Bad Request - null fields error
   - **Bug Discovered**: IPAddressForm was sending `null` for empty optional fields (DEF-007 recurring)
   - **Fixed**: src/components/IPAddressForm.tsx (lines 97-138) - implemented dynamic request body building
   - Changed from sending null ‚Üí omitting empty optional fields
   - Retry Result: ‚úÖ 201 Created - IP address successfully created
   - Created IP ID: 9b2a5f05-786d-4251-bccc-ab1a158446db
   - Redirected to detail page showing all fields correctly

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/IPAddressForm.tsx (lines 106-124: fixed null fields handling using DEF-007 pattern)

**Conclusion**: DEF-006 validation was already fully implemented with comprehensive IPv4/IPv6 regex validation at both schema and client-side levels. Discovered and fixed a null fields bug (DEF-007 recurring) in IPAddressForm that prevented valid IP creation. IP address validation now working correctly end-to-end.

#### 2.4 DEF-009: Vendor Dropdown Empty in Software Form
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE + TESTED - ALREADY WORKING (False Alarm)
**Tasks**:

   - `sso_protocol` field exists in schema (line 29): `z.string().max(50).optional()`
   - Both fields already present in CreateSaaSServiceSchema and UpdateSaaSServiceSchema
   - Form data state already included these fields (lines 38-39)
   - API request body already included these fields (lines 92-93)

2. **Code Changes** (src/components/SaaSServiceForm.tsx):

### Phase 3.5: New Defects Discovered During Phase 4 Testing

#### 3.5.1 DEF-010: IP Address Uniqueness Not Enforced
**Status**: üî¥ NEW DEFECT - Not Fixed
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Discovered During**: TS-008-SC-003 testing (2025-10-10)

**Issue**: The system allows duplicate IP addresses to be created. Database and API do not enforce uniqueness constraint on the `ip_address` field.

**Test Results**:
- Created IP address 10.10.100.51 (ID: fb92d96f-94f4-4f5e-b4c5-a579fbab394f)
- Attempted to create duplicate IP address 10.10.100.51
- Expected: 409 Conflict error with message "IP address already exists"
- Actual: Successfully created duplicate IP (ID: 4446a4b1-1071-4b65-be6c-46500e97738c)

**Root Cause**:
- Database schema (dbsetup.sql) does not have UNIQUE constraint on `ip_addresses.ip_address` column
- API validation does not check for existing IP addresses before creation

**Required Fixes**:
1. Add UNIQUE constraint to `ip_addresses` table: `ADD CONSTRAINT ip_addresses_ip_address_unique UNIQUE (ip_address)`
2. Add uniqueness validation in API endpoint (src/app/api/ip-addresses/route.ts POST handler)
3. Add user-friendly error message for duplicate IP attempts

**Impact**: Medium - Can lead to IP address conflicts in network management, but doesn't block core functionality

---

## Schema Alignment Process (2025-10-10)

### Problem Identified
Earlier development had created APIs and UI components based on assumed schema, but the actual database (from dbsetup.sql) used different field names and structures.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Source of Truth**: Established dbsetup.sql as the definitive schema
2. **Database Rebuild**: Created rebuild-database.js script to drop and recreate database from dbsetup.sql
3. **Systematic Updates**: Updated each object type in order:
   - TypeScript interfaces (src/types/index.ts)
   - Zod validation schemas (src/lib/schemas/*.ts)
   - API routes (src/app/api/*/route.ts and */[id]/route.ts)
   - Seed data files (seeds/*.sql)
4. **Testing**: Verified each API with curl commands before moving to next object
5. **UI Updates**: Deferred to ensure backend is solid first

### Key Schema Changes
- **Company**: `name` ‚Üí `company_name`, added 13 new fields, removed `status`
- **Location**: `name` ‚Üí `location_name`, consolidated address fields, added `location_type`, `timezone`, `contact_phone`, `access_instructions`
- **Room**: `name` ‚Üí `room_name`, uses `room_number` and `notes` fields
- **Person**: Uses `full_name`, `username`, `mobile` fields from dbsetup.sql

### Files Modified
- src/types/index.ts (Company, Location, Room, Person interfaces)
- src/lib/schemas/company.ts (all schemas)
- src/lib/schemas/location.ts (all schemas, LocationTypeSchema enum)
- src/lib/schemas/room.ts (all schemas)
- src/lib/schemas/person.ts (all schemas)
- src/app/api/companies/route.ts (POST and GET)
- src/app/api/companies/[id]/route.ts (PATCH)
- src/app/api/locations/route.ts (POST and GET)
- src/app/api/locations/[id]/route.ts (PATCH)
- seeds/002_rooms.sql (corrected schema)

### Pattern Established
1. Always verify schema against dbsetup.sql before implementation
2. Update in order: Types ‚Üí Schemas ‚Üí API ‚Üí Seeds ‚Üí UI
3. Test API endpoints with curl before UI work
4. Use database rebuild script when schema changes are significant
